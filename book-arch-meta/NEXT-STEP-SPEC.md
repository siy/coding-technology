# `next_step` — Engine Specification (v0.1 draft, 2026-07-12)

*Implementation ticket: pragmaticalabs/pragmatica#443 (rc3).*

*Working spec for the derivation engine proposed by the series review (§5) and split
by user ruling 2026-07-12: schema + this spec now; engine implementation post-ship,
ranked against the Aether book. Ground truth: Appendix A (worksheet), Appendix B
(reference cards), chapters 2–5. Where this spec and the book disagree, the book
wins and this spec has a bug.*

*Amended 2026-08-01. One real bug: the five-halt list had three entries that are ch. 5
verification failures rather than ch. 8 halts (`when-derivation-says-no.md` has no
inventory in the meta notes either, so the book is sole authority there). One naming
alignment: `BARE_ILITY` renamed `BARE_ADJECTIVE`, matching the book's own phrase and the
implemented engine. **A 2026-07-26 edit wrongly stripped the `F22`/`F23`/`F24`/`F26`
citations on the belief they resolved nowhere; they resolve to `PROCESS-DESIGN.md`'s
findings register and have been restored** — this is a meta document and citing meta
findings is correct. `check` and the mechanical half of `derive` are implemented as a
browser playground at `/method/architecture-synthesis/next-step/`; §7's jbct-module
placement is superseded for those and still open for a CLI. The ledger the engine needs
is `LEDGER.md` v0.2, not a gap.*

---

## 1. Purpose and honest scope

The book claims the derivation is mechanical and the judgment points are named.
`next_step` is that claim as an executable — **the entry gate and the bookkeeping,
not the oracle**:

- It **validates** an answer sheet the way the book's entry gate does: unpriced,
  unscoped, undecomposed, untriaged answers are rejected with the book's own
  vocabulary as error messages.
- It **computes** what the book computes: the pressure matrix, forced axis moves
  with their citing answers, halts, decision records with revisit triggers, and the
  verification arithmetic.
- It **stops** where the book stops. Named judgment points (recovery ties,
  contradiction choices, target setting, product picks — Card 5's refusals) are
  *emitted as output*, never resolved. An engine that auto-picks would contradict
  ch. 12 and overclaim exactly the way the book warns against.

**Non-goals (permanent, not v1 deferrals):** auto-resolving judgment ties; ledger
formalization beyond the published entries (false precision is a named genre
failure); recommending products; any output not derivable from sheet + rules.

## 2. Why it exists (strategic case, from the review)

1. Proves the mechanizability thesis in the strongest form — the thesis ships as
   software.
2. Delivers PFD Prediction #1 (linter-style tooling) by the author's own hand.
3. Concretizes the falsification invitation: `answer-sheet + observed-vector`
   issues on `siy/derivation-artifacts` become the counterexample corpus.
4. The schema becomes the series interchange format (PFD Phase-4 rows, JBCT
   use-case contracts, Arch sheets on one substrate).
5. The four published runs become the engine's golden tests.

## 3. The schema (deliverable now)

One TOML document per sheet (JSON isomorphic; TOML is the human-authored form).
`schema_version` from day one; engine pins the major.

```toml
schema_version = "0.1"

[meta]
system      = "companies-house"        # slug
era         = "2017-2025"              # era-pinning is mandatory
author      = "..."
date        = 2026-07-12               # registration date
mode        = "greenfield"             # greenfield | living

# ---- The nine questions. One [[answers.qN]] block per scoped row. ----
# Common row fields:
#   scope     = "operation:submit-filing" | "data-class:filings" | "path:search" | "system"
#   statement = the answer in prose (numbers inline)
#   status    = "answered" | "UNKNOWN"          # UNKNOWN is valid input, never guessed
#   price     = what the number costs / the 53rd-minute consequence (Q1/Q2 rows)
#   source    = citation or "elicited:<who>"    # provenance survives into output

[[answers.q1]]   # Time budget — per operation
scope      = "path:company-search"
statement  = "P95 <= 200 ms at the register's read peak"
shape      = "system-clock"            # system-clock | requester-clock (triage, Card 3)
price      = "read path engineering; see Q8 envelope"

[[answers.q5]]   # Load — magnitude steady/peak, shape = volume|contention|burst|deadline,
                 #        concentration, window   (shape is the second-copy triage, Card 3)
[[answers.q6]]   # External constraints — kind = audit|replay|residency|mandate;
                 #        mandates carry strikes = ["axis:value", ...]

```

Schema notes:
- **Scope is a typed string** (`operation:` / `data-class:` / `path:` / `policy:` /
  `system`) — the scope test and narrowest-scope rule need it machine-comparable.
- **Composite/bundled answers are representable but flagged**: the entry gate
  rejects "we need full history" style rows unless decomposed (`q6.kind` forces
  audit vs replay; team-independence rows force ownership vs release fields).
- Anything the book marks judgment stays **prose in `statement`** — the schema
  never invents enums the method doesn't have.
- **The normal form is enforced (2026-08-03).** Card 5's one-row-per-unit rule is now a
  gate check and a computation, not a convention. `diverges` and `diverges_on` are
  rejected as `UNNORMALIZED`: a sheet that asserts divergence has done the deriving
  itself, and the engine would be reading a conclusion rather than a demand. Divergence
  is computed instead — q7 by comparing each unit's `cadence` against the system-scoped
  baseline, q9 by comparing typed attributes (`regulation`, `volume`, `data_shape`,
  `access_pattern`) against that baseline, with two storage shapes on one unit pressing
  polyglot and a unit differing from the baseline on two or more attributes pressing
  per-component. Comparing typed fields also retired the exact-match vocabulary that
  could not tell Companies House's "shape" from profile 3's "data shape". All four
  corpus sheets reproduce their recorded derivations with the assertions removed, which
  is the evidence that the divergence was always computable from what the sheets already
  stated.
- **Silence is distinguished from absence.** A sheet where no unit states a cadence now
  reports divergence as *unknowable* rather than as *no divergence* — the two were
  previously the same output, and only one of them is honest.

## 4. Pipeline (mirrors Card 5 exactly)

```
parse → 1 normalize → 2 prune → 3 press → 4 resolve → 5 verify → emit
```

**1. Normalize = the entry gate as validation errors.** Error catalog (messages use
the book's vocabulary; each cites its card):
- `UNPRICED` — Q1/Q2 row without a price: "state the 53rd-minute consequence."
- `UNSCOPED` — row at `system` scope where the question demands per-operation /
  per-data-class / per-path.
- `UNDECOMPOSED` — "audit" without audit-vs-replay; "team independence" without
  ownership-vs-release; bundled answers generally.
- `UNTRIAGED` — time answer without requester-vs-system clock (F22, Card 3); failure
  answer citing an observed failure as if it were a target (F23).
- `BARE_ADJECTIVE` — "scalability", "high availability", "performance": not answers.
  The book's phrase is *bare adjectives*, and it names the banned vocabulary
  explicitly (`answer-sheet.md:47`). Not "-ility" — that word belongs to the separate
  ledger argument (`axes-and-ledger.md:5`).
- `MISSING_SHAPE` — Q5 row without volume/contention/burst/deadline.
- `MISSING_DOMAIN_SHAPE` — effectful operation named anywhere without its
  domain-shape row (recovery cannot be derived without it).
- `UNKNOWN` rows pass the gate (valid input) and propagate as UNKNOWN pressure —
  surfaced in output, never guessed (grade-honesty; ch. 7's register).

**2. Prune.** Mechanical: `q6` mandate rows carry explicit `strikes`; struck values
leave the menu with the striking answer recorded. Binary; no weights.

**3. Press.** Per row: containment walk up the rungs (hardware sizing → cache →
coalescing → replicas → projections) using the row's shape to pick the mechanism
family (Card 3); contained ⇒ *inert* (recorded as a result, not discarded);
uncontained ⇒ pressure record `(axis, direction, scope, mechanism)`.
**Combination check is first-class** (F24, echoed by Card 5's "check combinations, not
just rows"; F26 for the scope-composition reading): pairs of rows from different
questions converging on one axis are evaluated after singles. Output: the pressure matrix, inert rows included.

**4. Resolve.** Mechanical where the book is mechanical: cheapest containing value ·
fewest new mechanisms · narrowest scope · rungs before moves · scope exclusion
before hardening. Conflict rule: different scopes ⇒ split at the boundary with the
four named split prices attached; same scope ⇒ decompose further; still opposed ⇒
**CONTRADICTION halt** emitting the renegotiation-menu skeleton (each branch priced,
each branch marked "re-enters the derivation"). Recovery per effectful operation
from domain shape, design-out checked first; **a recovery tie is a judgment point,
emitted and not resolved.**

**5. Verify.** The exit gate, arithmetic only: latency decomposition down the
critical path against `floors`; tail composition (slow-fractions in series, fan-out
harvest); envelope composition by correlation; availability multiplication with
earned-independence checks (shared deploys/certs/regions/config named in the sheet);
the mechanism-bill rule (Card 6: count of standing mechanisms × who-operates) against the Q8
envelope. Floors the user didn't supply ⇒ `UNVERIFIED: floor missing`, never a
default.

**Emit.** Two formats from one result object:
- Human: markdown report — vector (every position with its citing answers, F10),
  pressure matrix, decision records (`position · forced by · via · costs ·
  revisit when`), halts, judgment points, inert-rows appendix.
- Machine: JSON — the same, for the artifacts repo and for diffing runs.

**Halts (all five, ch. 8 — `when-derivation-says-no.md`):** contradiction (no vector
satisfies the answers) · infeasible intermediate (the target derives cleanly and no
operable path leads there) · trapped state (the current position was never forced and
the exit costs more than the occupancy) · knowledge gap (UNKNOWN on rows the
derivation cannot proceed without; the output is the list of blocking unknowns) ·
unexplored territory (answers are real and priced and the ledger has no entry that
prices them — emitted verbatim as such).

*Not halts, though earlier drafts of this spec listed them as such:* fake answers are
an entry-gate/exit-gate function (`verification.md:5`), floors-exceed-target is the
latency-decomposition rule (`verification.md:23`), and envelope-exceeded is the
mechanism-bill rule. All three
are ch. 5 verification failures and are emitted as such.

## 5. CLI surface

- `next_step check sheet.toml` — entry gate only (the linter; PFD Prediction #1).
- `next_step derive sheet.toml` — full pipeline, greenfield or living (uses
  `current_vector` as the start when `mode = "living"`).
- `next_step audit sheet.toml` — living systems: for every held position, name the
  forcing answer; **silence = debt, by construction** (Card 7). v1.5, after derive.
- `next_step increment --changed <row-id>` — re-derive only implicated axes. v2.
- Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 gate errors · 2 halts/contradictions · 3 judgment points
  pending (scriptable in CI — the sheet as a checked artifact).

## 6. Golden tests

The four published runs' sheets, transcribed into schema form, live in
`siy/derivation-artifacts/schema/`. `derive` must reproduce each derivation's
recorded moves (grade-A CH run first — it is the cleanest transcript). A divergence
is either an engine bug or a book bug; both are findings.

## 7. Placement (recommendation, from the 2026-07-12 jbct survey)

**Build it in the jbct repo as a new module; expose as `jbct derive` from day one;
add a standalone `next_step` wrapper at book ship.**

Survey facts (jbct @ `../pragmatica/jbct`): picocli CLI + mirror Maven plugin, 14
subcommands registered in a static array in `JbctCommand`; Java 25, Maven
multi-module. TOML parsing is already first-class (`org.pragmatica-lite:toml` via
`TomlParser`/`ConfigLoader`); `jbct-core` carries a generic `Diagnostic` record
(file/line/col/severity/message — not Java-coupled) and shared IO; distribution is
`install.sh` + `jbct upgrade` self-update off GitHub releases. The Java-specific
center of mass (PEG parser → CST, 36 CST lint rules) is irrelevant to this engine
and stays untouched.

Why this placement:
- **Near-zero new infrastructure.** The engine is a TOML-consuming,
  diagnostic-emitting CLI — exactly what jbct's non-Java-specific layer already is.
  Entry-gate errors map 1:1 onto `Diagnostic` (TOML sheets have line numbers).
  A second distribution channel for a standalone tool is a standing mechanism the
  the mechanism-bill rule says we shouldn't buy while one already exists.
- **Same product thesis.** `jbct check` lints code against the methodology;
  `jbct derive` lints-and-derives the sheet. PFD Prediction #1 lands as one tool
  family, and JBDT (JBCT's design phase) already establishes that design-phase
  tooling belongs here.
- **The naming friction is real but deferrable.** The book is stack-independent;
  "install jbct" is the wrong first touch for a non-Java architect. Resolution: a
  thin `next_step` launcher (same tarball, same jar, different entry name — the
  binary named after the book's own procedure) added at ship, when that audience
  materializes. The open umbrella-brand decision can rename the wrapper later for
  the price of a symlink.

Implementation notes: new module `jbct-derive` depending on `jbct-core` only (no
parser, no aether-runtime needs); `@Command` class in the `cli` package + one entry
in `JbctCommand`'s `subcommands` array; machine output JSON — check pragmatica-lite
for an existing codec before adding any dependency (none is present in jbct today).

## 8. Risks and mitigations

- **False-precision drift** — contributors will ask the engine to resolve more.
  Mitigation: §1 non-goals are permanent; refusals are tested behavior (golden
  tests assert judgment points are *emitted*, not resolved).
- **Support burden post-announce** — entry-gate errors reframe "the tool got it
  wrong" into "the sheet is incomplete," which is the correct conversation; issue
  templates route the rest to counterexample intake.
- **Schema ossification** — `schema_version` + the four golden sheets as migration
  tests.
